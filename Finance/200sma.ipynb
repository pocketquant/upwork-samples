    "Here's some sample code that implements a live trading algorithm in Python using the ccxt library to access market data from an exchange, and the ta (technical analysis) library to calculate the 200-day moving average:\n",
    "\n",
    "This code connects to the Binance exchange using your API keys, fetches historical OHLCV (Open-High-Low-Close-Volume) data for the BTC/USDT symbol at a daily timeframe, and calculates the 200-day moving average using the SMAIndicator class from the ta library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code then enters a loop that checks the current price of BTC/USDT every few seconds. If the current price is above the 200-day moving average, the code creates a market order to buy 0.001 BTC and prints the order details.\n",
